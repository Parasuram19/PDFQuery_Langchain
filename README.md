# PDF Query with LangChain

This project demonstrates how to build a question-answering system for PDF documents using LangChain.  It allows you to query information from one or more PDF files using natural language.

## Overview

This application uses LangChain, a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models.  It simplifies the process of loading PDF data, creating embeddings, and querying the information within the PDFs using natural language questions.

## Features

* **PDF Loading:**  Loads content from PDF files. *(Specify if it handles single or multiple PDFs.)*
* **Question Answering:**  Allows users to ask questions about the PDF content in natural language.
* **Contextual Responses:**  Provides answers based on the context of the PDF documents.
* **LangChain Integration:**  Leverages LangChain's modules for efficient data processing and querying.  *(Mention specific LangChain components used, e.g., chains, agents, etc.)*
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **LangChain:** The core library for LLM application development.
   ```bash
   pip install langchain
[LLM Used]: Specify the LLM used (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face models, etc.). Include the installation command if needed. For example, for OpenAI:
Bash

pip install openai
PyPDF2 or other PDF parsing library: For extracting text from PDFs.
Bash

pip install PyPDF2  # Or other library you used
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used (e.g., tiktoken for token counting).
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
LLM API Key: You'll need an API key for the LLM you're using. (Provide instructions on how to obtain the API key. This is crucial.)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/PDFQuery_Langchain.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%25253Fq%25253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%2525253Fq%2525253Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/PDFQuery_Langchain.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd PDFQuery_Langchain
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Application
Place PDF Files: Place the PDF files you want to query in the designated directory. (Specify the directory name and path.)

Set API Key: Set your LLM API key as an environment variable or within the code. (Provide specific instructions on how to do this.  This is essential.)

Run the Script:

Bash

python app.py  # Replace app.py with the name of your main script
Interact with the Application: Follow the instructions in the terminal to ask questions about your PDFs.

Usage
Prepare PDFs: Make sure your PDF files are in the correct directory.
Run the app: Execute the Python script.
Ask Questions: Type your questions in the prompt and press Enter.
Receive Answers: The application will process your query and provide an answer based on the content of the PDFs.
Example
You: What is the main topic discussed in the PDF?
Bot: The PDF discusses [summarized topic].
LangChain Components Used
(Explain which LangChain components you used in your project.  For example:)

Chains: Describe the type of chain used (e.g., RetrievalQA chain).
Agents: (If applicable) Explain how agents are used.
Document Loaders: Specify which document loader is used (e.g., PyPDFLoader).
Embeddings: Mention the embedding model used (e.g., OpenAI embeddings).
